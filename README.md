## 🧭 Overview
The project involved the complete design and control of a three-wheel differential-drive robot using low-cost components.

**Key Highlights**
- PI/PID-based closed-loop motor control using Teensy 4.1 Microcontroller
- System identification and model validation in MATLAB/Simulink  
- Integration with ROS 2 Humble + micro-ROS for communication  
- Teleoperation and odometry feedback testing
